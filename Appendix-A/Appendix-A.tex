\section{\em ``How Software Users Recommend Tools to Each Other''}
\label{app-peer}

% \subsection{Data}

% The dataset participants analyzed to complete the tasks is available online.\footnote{https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data}

\subsection{Study Script}
\label{app-peer-tasks}

\subsubsection*{\large Pre Task:} 

The dataset is picked from kaggle.com’s Titanic competition: 

\url{https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic} \\

\noindent
The Variable descriptions are given here: 

\url{https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data} \\

\noindent
Answer any questions about the dataset. \\

\noindent
Please do not use the internet to answer the questions. \\

\noindent
Please work on the tasks together in pairs.   \\

\noindent
The time to spend on the task is 60 mins, which comes to 7 to 8 mins on each task. However, this is just a recommendation. 
(the participants were asked to do their best when answering the questions and not to bother about the time etc. ) \\

\noindent
Please use any tool you are comfortable with to answer these questions. This computer has Excel, Rstudio, Python, SAS JMP Pro 12, and MySQL Workbench. If you need anything else, we can download that as well.  \\

\noindent
\textbf{The total time for the task is 60 mins. Please do not spend more than 45 mins in the training tasks which comes to around 7 to 8 mins on each question.} 

\subsubsection*{\large Tasks:}

\textbf{Student Task}

\noindent
Task: For a to e, please to describe the relationship. For f the factors should be ranked from the most significant to least significant. You can use mean, mode, etc. to explain the ranking. \\

\noindent
\textbf{Using training data: (45 mins)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[a.] What is the relationship between the (gender, age) and number of sibling/spouse (SibSp) traveling? 
    \item[b.] What is the  relationship between the Title(you can find this in the name) and the number of children/parents (Parch) traveling? 
    \item[c.] What is the relationship between the Title(you can find this in the name) and the age and gender? 
    \item[d.] What is the relationship between (class, fair) and age? 
    \item[e.] What is the relationship between (the fare and class) and the city embarked? 
    \item[f.] Please rank all the factors (a-e) for their contribution to survival. The factors should be ranked from the most significant to least significant. You can use mean, mode, etc. to explain the ranking.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\textbf{On the testing data: (10 mins)}

Please find whether these people survived.

\begin{itemize}
    \item[a.] Chaffee, Mrs. Herbert Fuller (Carrie Constance Toogood)
    \item[b.] Robins, Mr. Alexander A
    \item[c.] Peltomaki, Mr. Nikolai Johannes 
    \item[d.] Abelseth, Mr. Olaus Jorgensen
    \item[e.] Mulvihill, Miss. Bertha E
    \item[f.] Thomas, Mr. John
    \item[g.] Daniels, Miss. Sarah
    \item[h.] Delalic, Mr. Redjo
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\textbf{LAS Analyst Task}

\noindent
Task: For a to c, please describe the relationship between the categories. For d the factors should be ranked from the most significant to least significant. You can use mean, mode, etc. to explain the ranking. \\

\noindent
\textbf{Using train.csv: (35 mins)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[a.] What is the relationship between the gender (Sex), age, and the number of siblings/spouse traveling (SibSp)? 
    \item[b.] What is the relationship between the Title (you can find this in the name- Mr., Mrs., Ms., Miss., Master., Dr.,  etc. There may be more than this) and the number of children/parents (Parch) traveling?
    \item[c.] What is the relationship between the fare, class (Pclass), and age? 
    \item[d.] Rank the factors for their contribution to survival. The factors should be ranked from the most significant to least significant. You can use any methods to explain the ranking. (1 = survived, 0 = died)
\end{itemize}
   

When you are comfortable with your answers to the tasks above or time is running out, please move on to the final task. Again, you must work together in pairs and you may not use the internet to answer the questions. \\

\noindent
\textbf{Using test.csv and your results from the previous task: (10 min.)}

Predict whether the following passengers survived:

\begin{itemize}
    \item[a.] Chaffee, Mrs. Herbert Fuller (Carrie Constance Toogood)
    \item[b.] Robins, Mr. Alexander A
    \item[c.] Peltomaki, Mr. Nikolai Johannes 
    \item[d.] Abelseth, Mr. Olaus Jorgensen
    \item[e.] Mulvihill, Miss. Bertha E
    \item[f.] Thomas, Mr. John
    \item[g.] Daniels, Miss. Sarah
    \item[h.] Delalic, Mr. Redjo
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection*{\large Post Task:} 

For the tasks you just completed, I’m interested in when you recommended a tool or program feature to complete the tasks. I noticed the following recommendations you made; let’s look back at them briefly. 
\textit{Open recommendation sheets.}

Do you recall making any other recommendations that I didn't write down, especially ones where help was not specifically asked for? \textit{Write them down.}

Now, let’s go through each one. May I turn on my audio recorder? \textit{Turn it on. Fill in interview portion.}


\subsection{Recommendation Sheet}

The following text was used by the researchers to track instances of peer interactions during the study sessions and to guide the discussion in the semi-structured interviews at the end of the tasks: \\

\noindent
\textbf{\Large Recommendation Sheet} \\

\textbf{Observation Data}

Person making the recommendation:  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Approximate time recommendation made:  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Tool recommended \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \\

\subsection{Interview Data}
\label{app-peer-interview}

\noindent
\textbf{Semi-structured}

\noindent
\~One effective and one ineffective tool recommendation

\noindent
Previous experience with tool of choice?

\noindent
For person making the recommendation:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Why did you decide to make this recommendation?
    \item Why did you make it this way? 
    \item Why did you phrase it this way?
    \item Why did you make it at this time?
    \item Did the recomendee react in the way you expected?
    \item Anything else we should know about this?
\end{itemize}

\noindent
For person who received the recommendation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item What did you think when you got the recommendation?
    \item How helpful was the recommendation for the task you were doing? For future tasks?
    \item How helpful was the timing of the recommendation?
    \item How disruptive was the timing of the recommendation?
    \item Anything else we should know about this?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Interaction Data List}
\label{app-peer-data}

For each recommendation observed in our study, we collected:

\begin{itemize}[topsep=0pt,itemsep=-1ex,partopsep=1ex,parsep=1ex]
    \item the type of peer interaction (Peer Observation or Peer Recommendation),
    \item the approximate time in the video the recommendation took place,
    \item which participants are the driver and navigator,
    \item the study task,
    \item the method of the driver and navigator (if possible),
    \item the name and type of the recommended feature,
    \item a transcript of the dialogue concerning the new tool,
    \item the reaction of the recommendee,
    \item instances in the study where the tool was re-used,
    \item instances where the tool was ignored for a less efficient method,
    \item the effectiveness, politeness, persuasiveness, and receptiveness scores, 
    \item whether the recommendations was under time pressure, and
    \item if the recommendation was discussed during the interview and time of discussion in the video.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Peer Interaction Characteristic Scoring}
