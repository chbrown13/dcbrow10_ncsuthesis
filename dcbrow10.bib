    abstract = {Preserving the integrity of software systems is essential in ensuring future product success. Commonly, companies allocate only a limited budget toward perfective maintenance and instead pressure developers to focus on implementing new features. Traditional techniques, such as code inspection, consume many staff resources and attention from developers. Metrics automate the process of checking for problems but produce voluminous, imprecise, and incongruent results. An opportunity exists for visualization to assist where automated measures have failed; however, current software visualization techniques only handle the voluminous aspect of data but fail to address imprecise and incongruent aspects. In this paper, we describe several techniques for visualizing possible defects reported by automated inspection tools. We propose a catalogue of lightweight visualizations that assist reviewers in weeding out false positives. We implemented the visualizations in a tool called NOSEPRINTS and present a case study on several commercial systems and open source applications in which we examined the impact of our tool on the inspection process.},

    abstract = {Recommendations between colleagues are effective for encouraging developers to adopt better practices. Research shows these peer interactions are useful for improving developer behaviors, or the adoption of activities to help software engineers complete programming tasks. However, in-person recommendations between developers in the workplace are declining. One form of online recommendations between developers are pull requests, which allow users to propose code changes and provide feedback on contributions. GitHub, a popular code hosting platform, recently introduced the suggested changes feature, which allows users to recommend improvements for pull requests. To better understand this feature and its impact on recommendations between developers, we report an empirical study of this system, measuring usage, effectiveness, and perception. Our results show that suggested changes support code review activities and significantly impact the timing and communication between developers on pull requests. This work provides insight into the suggested changes feature and implications for improving future systems for automated developer recommendations, such as providing situated, concise, and actionable feedback.},

abstract = {Almost every office worker can relate to feelings of email overload and stress, but in reality the concept of email strain is not well understood. In this paper, we describe a large-scale nationwide organizational survey examining the relationship between email use and feelings of email overload and task coordination. We found that higher email volume was associated with increased feelings of email overload, but this relationship was moderated by certain email management strategies. The contribution to the field of CSCW is a better understanding of the concept of email related stress, and initial scale development for the assessment of email-related overload and perceptions of the work-importance of email.},

@article{Shove,
Abstract = {This essay reexamines the idea of paternalism and the basis for finding it objectionable in light of recent writings on "libertarian paternalism." Suggestion: to qualify as paternalistic, an interference that restricts someone's liberty or interferes with her choice-making with the aim of helping the individual must be contrary to that very individual's will. A framework for determining the justifiability of paternalistic action is proposed, under the assumption that the individual has a personal prerogative, up to a point, to engage in less than maximally beneficial action. Beyond that point, the content of the will of the individual disposed against interference can extinguish the presumptive wrongness of paternalism. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},
